        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and
            collect when you use and visit <a href="https://strucko.com/">strucko.com</a>,
            and how we safeguard your information.
        </p>
        <p>
            We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.
            Some 3rd parties like Facebook, Twitter and Google may know you visited this website,
            if you use their services. We can not control them but we do not believe this
            knowledge poses any threat to you. We use Google AdSense platform to serve
            ads on our site, and this will make your web browser automatically send certain
            information to Google (for example, the web address of the page that you are
            visiting and your IP address). These are just the key points. If you need more detail,
            keep reading.
        </p>
        <h3>Measuring our visitors</h3>
        <p>
            We measure visitors to our website using
            <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics</a>.
            This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and
            some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous –
            so we do not know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.
            The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our
            sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites,
            we use this information to make our website better, but you can
            <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out</a> if you wish.
        </p>
