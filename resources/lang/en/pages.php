        <p>
        Strucko.com is built using <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel PHP framework</a> 
        for backend stuff, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL community edition</a> 
        for database storage,
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> as HTML, CSS, and JS framework 
        and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for some specific JavaScript tasks.
        We use the the <a href="http://antiblock.org/">anti-Adblock script</a> to prevent users
        from running ad blockers on our site. We plan to implement <a href="http://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> 
        to enable MVVM architectural pattern for software development.
        </p>
        <p>
        To get us started we have seeded our database with terms and definitions
        for several languages from
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx">
            MicrosoftÂ© Language Portal Terminology Collection.</a> 
        We have put those to the Computing scientific field.

        <p>
        The following types of cookie are used on this site. 
        We do not list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of
        cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
        <br><br>
        1. Analytics cookies
        <br>
        These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached 
        it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures 
        on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
        You can opt out of these if you want:
        Google: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
        Optimizely: https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out/
        <br><br>
        2. Third-party service cookies
        <br>
        Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other 
        companies. These companies may drop cookies on your computer when you 
        use them on our site or if you are already logged in to them.
        Here is a list of places where you can find out more about specific 
        services that we may use and their use of cookies:
        <br>
        Facebooks data use policy: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other
        <br>
        AddThis (the service that runs some of our social sharing buttons): http://www.addthis.com/privacy#.T6j--usS0bw

        <br><br>
        3. Our own ad serving and management cookies
        <br>
        We sell space on our website to advertisers - they pay for the content 
        you enjoy for free. As part of this, we use several services to 
        help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in.
        These cookies hold information about the computer - they do not hold 
        personal information about you (ie it is not linked to you as an individual).
        But they might hold a record of what other websites you have looked at - 
        so we could show you a car advert if you have previously visited a motoring website.
        These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. 
        Please note that turning off advertising cookies will not mean that you
        are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        <br>
        Doubleclick (advertising): Privacy policy at http://www.google.com/doubleclick/privacy/ and opt out viahttp://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
        <br>
        Google Adsense (ad partner): Privacy policy at https://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=link&gsessionid=DyXLmLB1J1MxXckh6tX6AQ&utm_campaign=ww-ww-et-asfe_&utm_source=aso&answer=48182 and opt-out via https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
        <br><br>
        4. Other ad management cookies
        <br>
        Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. 
        Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe 
        are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about 
        your visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, 
        our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer. 
        These cookies hold information about the computer - they do not hold 
        personal information about you (ie it is not linked to you as an individual).
        For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, 
        about cookies, and about how to turn this feature off, 
        please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
        Please note that turning off advertising cookies will not mean that you 
        are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        <br><br>
        5. Site management cookies
        <br>
        These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. 
        For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we 
        use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific 
        server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar
        cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote 
        once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not 
        logged in (to ensure you do not see comments you have reported as abusive, for
        instance, or do not vote comments up/down more than once).
        These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change 
        your browser setting to refuse all cookies (see above) if you do not 
        wish to accept them.

        Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and 
        collect when you use and visit <a href="http://strucko.com/">strucko.com</a>,
        and how we safeguard your information.
        </p>
        <p>
        We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.
        Some 3rd parties like Facebook, Twitter and Google may know you visited this website, 
        if you use their services. We can not control them but we do not believe this 
        knowledge poses any threat to you. We use Google AdSense platform to serve 
        ads on our site, and this will make your web browser automatically send certain 
        information to Google (for example, the web address of the page that you are 
        visiting and your IP address). If you sign up with us, we take great care 
        to keep your information safe and we will never share it with others without 
        your permission. We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us 
        deliver our own services. These are just the key points. If you need more detail, 
        keep reading.
        </p>
        <h2>Measuring our visitors</h2>
        <p>
        We measure visitors to our website using
        <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Google Analytics</a>.
        This records what pages you view within our site, how you arrived at our site and 
        some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous â 
        so we do not know who you are; just that somebody visited our site. 
        The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our 
        sites are doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on. Like most websites, 
        we use this information to make our website better, but you can 
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out</a> if you wish.
        </p>
        <h2>Serving Ads</h2>
        <p>
        We use the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a> platform to 
        serve ads on our site. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to 
        serve ads based on a user\'s prior visits to our website. 
        <br>
        Google\'s use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads 
        to users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. 
        The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of 
        its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google 
        certified ad networks. When users visit a partner\'s website and either view 
        or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user\'s browser. 
        Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising 
        by visiting <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Settings</a>. 
        Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. 
        Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site 
        running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
        </p>
        <p>
        For more information on how Google collects and uses your data, see this page: 
        <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and other social networks, enabled by AddThis</h2>
        <p>
        These services provide social buttons and similar features which we use on our 
        website â such as the "Like" and "Tweet" buttons. To do so we embed code that 
        they provide and we do not control ourselves. To function, their buttons generally 
        know if you are logged in; for example Facebook use this to say "x of your friends like this".
        We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it. 
        Social networks therefore could know that you are viewing this website, if you use their 
        services (that is not to say they do, but their policies may change). As our website is 
        remarkably inoffensive we imagine this is not a concern for most users. 
        To enable social buttons and similar features, we use the
        <a href="http://www.addthis.com/privacy">AddThis</a> platform.</p>
        <h2>Discussion comments</h2>
        <p>
        To allow visitors to discuss our web pages we use a discussion system called
        <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. To do so we embed code that Disqus
        provide and we do not control ourselves. Disqus anonymously tracks visitors to 
        pages like we do. They also remember who you are if you login to any Disqus service, 
        so you can comment on any website using their tool. Logging in to Disqus can be 
        done in many ways, including via Facebook. If you login via social network, 
        Disqus will be able to link your activity to that network. In this way, your 
        Disqus activity may be personally identifiable. Disqus will know what pages you 
        viewed in our site and what you wrote on those comments. Of course all comments 
        you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your name.
        </p>
        <h2>Our cookies</h2>
        <p>
        We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you 
        visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit,
        or the ability to login to some of our features, such as voting on terms and definitions.
        You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies 
        in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you are able to interact 
        with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login 
        to services, programs, or accounts.
        </p>
        <h2>If you sign up</h2>
        <p>
        If you sign up to strucko.com, we will record specific personal information about you,
        such as your name and email address. Your password is securely hashed (not stored in clear text).
        We will record your suggested terms, definitions, translations and all your votes 
        on terms and definitions.
        </p>
        <h2>Emails</h2>
        <p>
        We may send you email notifications regarding your account (such as email confirmation or password reset). 
        We may send you email which you have specifically requested (such as newsletters or notifications 
        when a report is completed). You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time. 
        We will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except 
        where they are specifically employed to help deliver our own services, as detailed above.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
        We take many precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. 
        These precautions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hardware stored in secured datacentres behind firewalls</li>
        <li>All access to information restricted by password and/or secure key</li>
        <li>Restrictions to what information can be accessed via any location</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Whilst we take great care to ensure any confidential information remains protected,
        we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet. 
        Of course you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. 
        Nobody at strucko.com will ever ask you for your password, so please do not trust anybody asking it.
        </p>
        <h2>Updates to this policy</h2>
        <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. 
        You can always check this page for the latest version. We may also notify you of changes 
        to our privacy policy by email.
        </p>
        <h2>Any questions?</h2>
        <p>
        If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please write to us by email.
