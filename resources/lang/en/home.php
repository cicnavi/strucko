                Strucko is open, free and
                community driven IT dictionary. As a guest user, you are free to view all (approved)
                terms, translations and definitions. If you want to contribute to the dictionary,
                you can create an account which will give you permissions to vote on all terms and their
                translations, and also to suggest new terms, translations and definitions.
                By voting, you participate in the process of defining the best term and
                translation for particular concept. And that's why Strucko is great -
                it shows us the opinion of the community!
            </p>
            <p>
                To get us started we've seeded our database with terms and definitions
                using
                <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx\">
                    MicrosoftÂ© Language Portal Terminology Collection.</a>
                We will try to add more terms and definitions from different sources with open
                access. If you know one, let us know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to contact us if you have any other suggestion.
