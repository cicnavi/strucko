        <h2>Introducing Strucko - The Expert Dictionary </h2>
        <p>
            Although there are several great (and free) translation services, and 
            thousands of online dictionaries available to us, there is still a 
            huge gap in good online translations for technical or very specific 
            terms related to some area, field, craft, occupation, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the technology is improving on a day to day basis, and every day
            we have new discoveries which are named in one language, there is a 
            delay in <i>official</i> translations to other languages. Those
            official translations can sometimes be cumbersome, clumsy or awkward.
            Because of all that, translators still find it difficult to find 
            appropriate translations in cases when they need to translate professional text.
