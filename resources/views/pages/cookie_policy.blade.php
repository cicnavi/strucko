    <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Like most websites, strucko.com uses cookies.
        <br>
        Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. 
        They're used for many things, such as remembering whether you've visited 
        the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out 
        how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information 
        about the use of your computer but don't include personal information 
        about you (they don't store your name, for instance).
        <br>
        This policy explains how cookies are used on Strucko.com website in general
        - and, below, how you can control the cookies that may be used on this 
        site (not all of them are used on every site).
    </p>

    <h2>Types of cookie that may be used during your visit to the Website</h2>
    <p>
        The following types of cookie are used on this site. 
        We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of
        cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
        <br><br>
        1. Analytics cookies
        <br>
        These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached 
        it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures 
        on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
        You can opt out of these if you want:
        Google: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
        Optimizely: https://www.optimizely.com/opt_out/

        <br><br>
        2. Third-party service cookies
        <br>
        Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other 
        companies. These companies may drop cookies on your computer when you 
        use them on our site or if you are already logged in to them.
        Here is a list of places where you can find out more about specific 
        services that we may use and their use of cookies:
        <br>
        Facebook's data use policy: http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other
        <br>
        AddThis (the service that runs some of our social sharing buttons): http://www.addthis.com/privacy#.T6j--usS0bw
        <br>
        Twitter's privacy policy: https://twitter.com/privacy
        <br>
        YouTube video player cookie policy: http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/faq/#toc-cookies(Google's standard terms).
        <br>
        Disqus cookie policy: https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466235-use-of-cookies
        <br><br>
        3. Our own ad serving and management cookies
        <br>
        We sell space on our website to advertisers - they pay for the content 
        you enjoy for free. As part of this, we use several services to 
        help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in.
        These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold 
        personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
        But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - 
        so we could show you a car advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
        These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. 
        Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you
        are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        <br>
        Doubleclick (advertising): Privacy policy at http://www.google.com/doubleclick/privacy/ and opt out viahttp://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
        <br>
        Google Adsense (ad partner): Privacy policy at https://support.google.com/adsense/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&utm_medium=link&gsessionid=DyXLmLB1J1MxXckh6tX6AQ&utm_campaign=ww-ww-et-asfe_&utm_source=aso&answer=48182 and opt-out via https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
        
        <br><br>
        4. Other ad management cookies
        <br>
        Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. 
        Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe 
        are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about 
        your visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, 
        our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer. 
        These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold 
        personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
        For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, 
        about cookies, and about how to turn this feature off, 
        please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
        Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you 
        are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.


        <br><br>
        5. Site management cookies
        <br>
        These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. 
        For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we 
        use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific 
        server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar
        cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote 
        once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not 
        logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for
        instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).
        These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change 
        your browser setting to refuse all cookies (see above) if you do not 
        wish to accept them.
