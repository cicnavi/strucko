## Strucko - Open, free and community driven expert dictionary

The idea behind Strucko is to create open, free and community driven expert dictionary. 
Anyone can register and contribute to the dictionary by suggesting new terms, 
translations and definitions for existing terms. 
While suggestions are visible to registered (and logged in) users, the 
user with administrator role can approve suggestions, which makes them publicly 
visible.

Terms can be entered in different languages, and added to different scientific fields.
The user chooses the language, scientific field and part of speech for the term.
Administrator checks the suggestion, and if everything is OK, he approves the term.
